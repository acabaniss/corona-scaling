This Jupyter notebook is a replication attempt of Stier et al.'s preprint on Arxiv [1]. This notebook brings together MSA definitions and census data to allow demographic calculations for MSAs in relation to the coronavirus outbreak. The MSAs are a county-level unit delineated by the Census Bureau (see https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/metro-micro/about/delineation-files.html). The coronavirus outbreak data are provided by USAFacts (https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map/, last downloaded March 25th, 2020 14:34 EDT).
